# AugTrans
An augmented transcript-level RNA-seq quantification pipeline (under development).
Novel transcripts from alternative splicing events have been recognized for their role in shaping various biological processes. However, prior studies focused on gene-level expression, overlooking transcript-level information. Moreover, transposable elements (TEs) previously considered non-expressed are now known to be widely expressed in tumor tissues, suggesting great potential as tumor-specific antigen targets by providing protein-coding and regulatory sequences to novel transcripts. The availability of high-quality full-length scRNA-seq datasets, along with EM-based tools such as Salmon that demonstrate high quantification accuracy, enables further investigation in these two aspects. Based on these insights, we developed an augmented transcript-level quantification pipeline for a reference transcriptome comprising 1,000,000 well-annotated transcripts and 3,000,000 TE loci.
